            The Community is #1 for us here at Goofy Giraffes. To satisfy our
            community, we understand that the artwork itself is not sufficient.
            We are working towards expanding our community organically and we
            are proud of where we are at today.

            Building a community of like-minded individuals is what ‘Goofy
            Giraffes’ is all about. Having people who are equally interested in
            NFTs as well as TV Shows is what we strive to achieve. The core of
            the project revolves around the development of our artwork that has
            traits of the characters you watch and adore.
